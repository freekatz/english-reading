    The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, ¡°Beautiful Inside My Head Forever¡±,at Sotheby¡¯s in London on September 15th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more than ¡ê70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer
called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.
@##
  The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare Mc Andrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm¡ªdouble the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries.
@##
    In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst¡¯s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable, especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector¡ªfor Chinese contemporary art¡ªthey were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world¡¯s two biggest auction houses, Sotheby¡¯s and Christie¡¯s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.
@##
    The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the  end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie¡¯s chief executive, says: ¡°I¡¯m pretty confident we¡¯re at the bottom.¡±
@##
    What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie¡¯s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who  was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds¡ªdeath, debt and divorce¡ªstill deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

    I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room¡ªa women's group that had invited men
to join them. Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and said, "She's the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt. "It's true," he explained. "When I come home from work, I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence."
@##
    This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.
@##     
The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book "Divorce Talk" that most of the women she interviewed¡ªbut only a few of the men¡ªgave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent,that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year ¡ªa virtual epidemic of failed
conversation.
@##
    In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning, cooking, social arrangements and errands. Instead they focused on communication: "He doesn't listen to me." "He doesn't talk to me." I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives.
@##
    In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting to talk.

All of the following are true EXCEPT
@# men tend to talk more in public than women
@# nearly 50 percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation
@# women attach much importance to communication between couples

    Over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors ¡ª habits ¡ª among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.
@##
    ¡°There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers only because we can¡¯t figure out how to change people¡¯s habits,¡± Dr. Curtis said. ¡°We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.¡±
@##
    The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to ¡ª Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever ¡ª had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers¡¯ lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines.
@##
If you look hard enough, you¡¯ll find that many of the products we use every day ¡ª chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins¡ª are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.
@##
A few decades ago, many people didn¡¯t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.
@##
    ¡°Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,¡± said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. ¡°Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers¡¯ lives, and it¡¯s  essential to making new products commercially viable.¡±
@##
    Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods.

According to Dr. Curtis, habits like hand washing with soap

    Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.
@##
    But as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
@##
    The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.
@##
    In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.
@@@
#@@
From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that
@#both liberate and illiterate people can serve on juries
@#defendants are immune from trial by their peers
@#no age limit should be imposed for jury service
@#judgment should consider the opinion of the public
#@@
The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed
@#the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws
@#the prevalent discrimination against certain races
@#the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures
@#the arrogance common among the Supreme Court justices

Even in the 1960s, women were seldom on the jury list in some states because
@#they were automatically banned by state laws
@#they fell far short of the required qualifications
@#they were supposed to perform domestic duties
@#they tended to evade public engagement
#@@
After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed.
@# sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished
@# educational requirements became less rigid in the selection of federal jurors
