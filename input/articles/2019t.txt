Unlike so-called basic emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger, guilt emerges a little later, in conjunction with a
child's growing grasp of social and moral norms. Children aren¡¯t born knowing how to say ¡°I¡¯m sorry¡±; rather, they
learn over time that such statements appease parents and friends -- and their own consciences. This is why researchers
generally regard so-called moral guilt, in the right amount, to be a good thing.
@##
In the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable -- it¡¯s the emotional
equivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. ¡°There has been a kind of
revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve,¡± says Amrisha Vaish, a psychology researcher
at the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren't binary --feelings
that may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and anger, for example, may have
evolved to alert us to important inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive.
@##
And guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness, can encourage humans to make up for errors
and fix relationships. Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together. It is a kind of social glue.
@##
Viewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of
Toronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies, Malti and others have
shown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing Some Kids who are low in
sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt, which can rein in their nastier impulses. And vice
versa: High sympathy can substitute for low guilt.
@##
In a 2014 study, for example, Malti looked at 244 children Using caregiver assessments and the children¡¯s
self-observations, she rated each child¡¯s overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions after
moral transgressions. Then the kids were handed chocolate coins, and given a chance to shared them with an
anonymous child. For the low-sympathy kids, how much they shared appeared to turn on how inclined they were to feel
guilty. The guilt-prone ones shared more, even though they hadn¡¯t magically become more sympathetic to the other
child¡¯s deprivation.
@##
¡° That¡¯s good news,¡± Malti says. ¡° We can be prosocial because we caused harm and we feel regret,¡±

Forests give us shade, quiet and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change. Even as we
humans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to
do so. The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb.
@##
Thankfully, there is a way out of this trap-but it involves striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as
valuable ¡°carbon sinks¡± long into the future may require reducing their capacity to sequester carbon now. California is
leading the way, as it does on so many climate efforts, in figuring out the details.
@##
The state¡¯s proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of
the forest, including by controlled burning. This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees
draw a greater share of the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest¡¯s capacity to pull carbon
from the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off insects. The landscape is rendered less easily burnable. Even
in the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed.
@##
The need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010, drought and insects have killed over 100
million trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres.
@##
California¡¯s plans treat 35,000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,000 by 2030 -financed from the proceeds of
the state¡¯s emissions-permit auctions. That¡¯s only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit, about half a
million acres in all, so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought.
@##
The strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the
form of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels. New research on
transportation biofuels is already under way.
@##
State governments are well accustomed to managing forests, but traditionally they¡¯ve focused on wildlife,
watersheds and opportunities for recreation. Only recently have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play
in storing carbon. Califormia¡¯s plan, which is expected to be finalized by the governor next year, should serve as a
model.

American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years now.Given a multi- year decline in
illegal immigration, and a similarly sustained pickup in the U.S. job market, the complaints are unlikely to stop without
an overhaul of immigration rules for farm workers.
@##
Congress has obstructed Efforts to crate a more straightforward agricultural-workers visa that would enable foreign workers to stay longer
in the U.S. and change jobs within the industry have so far failed in Congress.If this doesn¡¯t change.American
businesses.communities and consumers will be the losers.
@##
Perhaps half of U.S. farm laborers are undocumented immigrants. As fewer such workers enter the U.S., the
characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing. Today¡¯s farm laborers, while still predominantly born in
Mexico, are more likely to be settled, rather than migrating, and more likely to be married than single. They are also
aging. At the start of this century, about one-third of crop workers were over the age of 35. Now, more than half are. And crop picking is hard on older bodies. One oft-debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it has
been all along: Native U.S. workers won¡¯t be returning to the farm.
@##
Mechanization is not the answer either¡ªnot yet at least. Production of com,cotton, rice, soybeans and wheat has
been largely mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, such as strawberries, need labor. Even dairy
farms,where robots do a small share of milking, have a long way to go before they are automated.
@##
As a result, farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps
in the agricultural workforce. Starting around 2012, requests for the visas rose sharply; from 2011 to 2016 the number
of visas issued more than doubled.
@##
The H-2A visa has no numerical cap, unlike the H-2B visa for nonagricultural work, which is limited to 66,000
annually.Even so,employers frequently complain they aren¡¯t allotted all the workers they need.The process is
cumbersome,expensive,and unreliable. One survey found that bureaucratic delays led H-2A worker to arrive on the job
an average of 22 days late. And the shortage is compounded by federal immigration raids, which remove some workers
and drive others underground.
@##
In a 2012 survey, 71 percent of tree-fruit growers and nearly 80 percent of raisin and berry growers said they were
short of labor. Some western growers have responded by moving operations to Mexico. From 1998-2000, 14.5 percent
of the fruit Americans consumed was imported. Little more than a decade later, the share of imported fruit had
increased to 25.8 percent.
@##
In effect, the U.S. can import food or it can import the workers who pick it.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dia Mirza and Adrian Grenier have a message for you: It¡¯s easy to beat plastic. They¡¯re
part of a bunch of celebrities staring in a new video for World Environment Day¡ªencouraging you, the consumer, to
swap out your single-use plastic staples like straws and cutlery to combat the plastic crisis.
@##
The key messages that have been put together for World Environment Day do include a call for governments to
enact legislation to curb single-us plastics. But the overarching message is directed at individuals.
@##
My concern with leaving it up to the individual, however, is our limited sense of what needs to be achieved. On
their own, taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws, for example, will accomplish little and
require very little of us. They could even be detrimental, satisfying a need to have ¡°done our bit¡± without ever
progressing onto bigger, bolder, more effective actions ¡ª a kind of ¡°moral licensing¡± that allays our concerns and stops
us doing more and asking more of those in charge.
@##
While the conversation around our environment and our responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping
bags and straws, we¡¯re ignoring the balance of power that implies that as ¡°consumers¡± we must shop sustainably, rather
than as ¡°citizens¡± hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change.
@##
It¡¯s important to acknowledge that the environment isn¡¯t everyone¡¯s priority - or even most people¡¯s. We shouldn¡¯t
expect it to be. In her latest book, Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things, Wellesley College professor
Elizabeth R. DeSombre argues that the best way to collectively change the behavior of large numbers of people is for
the change to be structural.
@##
This might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action,
or banning single-use plastics altogether. India has just announced it will ¡°eliminate all single-use plastic in the country
by 2022.¡± There are also incentive-based ways of making better environmental choices easier, such as ensuring
recycling is at least as easy as trash disposal.
@##
DeSombre isn¡¯t saying people should stop caring about the environment. It¡¯s just that individual actions are too
slow, she says, for that to be the only, or even primary, approach to changing widespread behavior.
@##
None of this is about writing off the individual. It¡¯s just about putting things into perspective. We don¡¯t have time
to wait. We need progressive policies that shape collective action (and rein in polluting businesses), alongside engaged
citizens pushing for change.
